TL;DR &#8211; Starting a business is hard and most fail.

The NYC has posted an [interesting article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?pagewanted=all) about the app store boom. &nbsp;The article focuses on a couple that bet everything on developing a business around making apps. &nbsp;While I agree with the articles premise that making a living on the app store is a &nbsp;very hard thing to do (see [Zynga&#8217;s collapse](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57537858-93/as-zynga-falters-so-does-facebook/)), the article failed to mention that _any_ startup is hard. &nbsp;The majority of [startups fail](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190.html) regardless of the industry.

As someone who has been following the app store for many years the gold rush period has long been over. &nbsp;Flooding the app store with bad apps is no longer a way to make money. &nbsp;Users expect apps to be much higher quality than in 2009. &nbsp;High quality takes time and money to develop.

Discoverability it hard. &nbsp;Even if the app is high&nbsp;quality&nbsp;and solves a genuine problem for the user, it may remain impossible to find. &nbsp;People complain about the app stores discoverability like this is a problem unique to Apple, but it&#8217;s not. &nbsp;Discoverability is hard in any business. &nbsp;Having a great product is simply not enough. &nbsp;Potential users must be told about the product.

One positive for the couple in the article is the husband learned how to write apps. &nbsp;While the app store gold rush may be over, the app store is not going away. &nbsp;Users increasingly expect every product to have a corresponding mobile app. &nbsp;Mobile web works for some products, but users expect a quality that is still hard to reach with todays mobile technology. &nbsp;As Steve Jobs so famously [said](http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/23/dld-2012-drew-houston-yes-steve-jobs-called-dropbox-a-feature/) about DropBox, apps will increasingly become features of a larger product. &nbsp;Dropbox on the other hand has turned out differently.
