What a crazy year. &nbsp;So the blog kind of fell off as work got really busy along with life. &nbsp;Now that I have gotten life back to a normal pace I plan to resume writing both the blog and some new iPhone apps. &nbsp;I have a few ideas kicking around and will be working on them as I have time.

iAutoCalc is on my list of TODOs that needs to get updated to the iOS 5. &nbsp;I have ran it under each version of iOS and it appears to be working fine, but the code will not compile on anything past iOS 3 right now. &nbsp;Thus, some of my older posts on objective-c unable to compile in some instances. &nbsp;I&#8217;m hoping to get it cleaned up soon.
