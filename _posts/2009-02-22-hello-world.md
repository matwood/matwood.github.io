The typical starter blog post. I went through many names before finding &#8220;The Pensive Programmer.&#8221; It&#8217;s quite annoying the number of abandoned blogs out there that are occupying many good names.

So what is this blog about?

First, I plan to write about my ideas on anything and everything that has to do with the creation of software. I hope that my ideas can spur on further discussions. I have only been writing software professionally for a little over 10 years and know enough to know that there is a lot I do not know.

Second, this blog will be a place where I write about interesting problems that come up at work and how I solved them. Hopefully these answers can be helpful to others and through discussion I can find even better solutions to the problems I come across. I come across various blogs all of the time that provide me with solutions to problems and it is time I give back. Knowledge wants to be shared.
