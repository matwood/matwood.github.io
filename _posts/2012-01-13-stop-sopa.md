This issue is too important to ignore so I&#8217;ve been trying to build a post that explains what SOPA is and why it is not the answer. &nbsp;Turns out that Tim O&#8217;Reilly has recently given an interview about why SOPA isn&#8217;t needed and should be stopped. &nbsp;As a publisher who benefits from copyright, he explains in a&nbsp;clear and concise manner&nbsp;why SOPA is not needed. &nbsp;Read the full [interview](http://gigaom.com/2012/01/13/tim-oreilly-why-im-fighting-sopa/) at [GigaOM](http://gigaom.com/).
