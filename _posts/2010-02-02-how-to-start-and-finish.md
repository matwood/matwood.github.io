I came across [this](http://www.43folders.com/2009/08/04/enough) on [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/). Anytime I&#8217;m lacking motivation I always pick some random article from the site. I was procrastinating tonight and came across this talk about starting something AND finishing it.

  Like most people I have lots of ideas that I think are great. I&#8217;ve started many of them, but never finished any of them (outside of work of course) &#8211; basically I&#8217;m suffering from <a href="">brain crack</a>. Starting is generally easy for me, but finishing is hard. I have come up with all kinds of excuses in the past.
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I&#8217;m too busy
    </li>
    <li>
      The idea sucks
    </li>
    <li>
      Technology is too hard
    </li>
    <li>
      I not smart enough
    </li>
    <li>
      I don&#8217;t have time to learn it
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    What&#8217;s interesting is that I write software at work all day and these excuses never get in way. I start and finish project after project. So, I&#8217;ve decided to start and finish two personal projects before starting any others. It doesn&#8217;t matter if they suck or if I find the ideas have already been done (more excuses). The point here is to take these two projects to completion before moving on.

    Why two projects? Well sometimes I really do need something else to do. I solve a lot of software problems while I&#8217;m in the gym, taking a shower, or simply working on something else. I think that having two projects will help me stay focused instead of running into a problem and getting sucked into the internet vortex.

    Project 1 is an iPhone application. It&#8217;s a pretty simple utility app, but I think it is genuinely useful. As I get closer to completing it I&#8217;ll give a full description of what it is and how I think it can help people. I have already learned a lot about iPhone development and objective-c in general. I have a few posts planned that should be up soon.

    Project 2 is a small website developed using RoR. I&#8217;ve played around with RoR in the past, but never took a project to a releasable state. I&#8217;ll explain more about the idea later, because it&#8217;s currently taking a backseat to project 1.

    Finally, the main reason I put this out here is because telling people I&#8217;m going to do something is a motivating thing. Doing something in secret means I can quit and no one will ever know. When I start telling every person I see that I&#8217;m working on something it creates an expectation that the next time I see that person I want to have an update for them.
