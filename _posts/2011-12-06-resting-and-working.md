People who write software are using their creativity to solve problems. &nbsp;I compare it to writing using a very precise language and grammar to express a story to the user. &nbsp;I came across this video over at the [99%](http://the99percent.com/videos/7110/Tony-Schwartz-The-Myths-of-the-Overworked-Creative). &nbsp;In it Tony Schwartz, author of &#8220;[The Way We&#8217;re Working Isn&#8217;t Working](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439127662/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thepensprog-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1439127662)&#8220;, relates athletic performance to creative performance. &nbsp;One thing athletes have known for years is that the rest between workouts is just as important as the workout itself. &nbsp;While it seems&nbsp;intuitive&nbsp;that it would work the same way with mental work, many creative professionals skip the rest part in order to squeeze in more work. &nbsp;This additional work is usually lower quality and eventually the lack of rest becomes detrimental to creativity.
