When I was in graduate school one of my fellow students was a C++ fanatic. &nbsp;To him, every software problem was best solved by C++. &nbsp;To his credit he probably could solve any problem using C++, but was that really the best use of his time? &nbsp;By assuming C++ as the best language choice for every problem was he being lazy or simply over working himself?

The common&nbsp;adage&nbsp;to&nbsp;describe&nbsp;the&nbsp;scenario&nbsp;above is &#8220;when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.&#8221; &nbsp;Of course you need a hammer because there are a lot of nails in the world, but there are also a lot of other types of problems. &nbsp;C++ is well suited to a large (and shrinking, depending on who you talk to) problem domain, but is it really best language to use to develop a web site? &nbsp;How about loading data into a database, parsing text files, or creating CRUD GUI interfaces?

Each of the problems I listed above have programming languages that _fit_ the problem domain better than any other language. &nbsp;It may take some time up front to learn a new language, but that time spent is well worth the effort of a simpler to develop to solution.

The lazy programmer, instead of letting tools drive solutions, lets the solutions drive the tools.
