About 6 months ago I came across an ex-Navy Seal named Jocko Willink. His no-nonsense approach to produtivity resonated with me.

It has taken 6 months to get where I am on the path, and the my next step is to write more. I am someone who works in code all day long, so the obvious question is why write more instead of say code more. There are two reasons:

- Writing down thoughts is great way to take partial ideas and make them concrete. It also forces the writer to work through the idea to a deeper level.
- Written communication is key to _any_ profession no matter the level. Software in particulary is almost always a team activity. Creating great software requires effective communication. In a later post, I may even argue that effective communication is required over all else, technical expertise included.
